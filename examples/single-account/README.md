# Onboarding an AWS Account with Multiple Regions Example

---

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to onboard an AWS account by provisioning the necessary Aqua Security resources and configurations across multiple regions.

## Pre-requisites

Before running this example, ensure that you have the following:

1. Terraform installed (version `1.9.0` or later).
2. AWS CLI installed and configured.
3. Aqua Security account API credentials.

## Usage

1. Obtain the Terraform configuration file generated by the Aqua platform.
2. Replace the placeholder values (`<REPLACE_ME>`) in the example configuration with your actual Aqua Security API credentials and other required values.
3. **Log in to your desired AWS account using the AWS CLI.**
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
5. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources.

## What's Happening

- The `aqua_aws_onboarding` module is called to create the discovery and scanning resources across multiple AWS regions (`us-east-1`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-south-1`).

## Outputs

- `onboarding_status`: The output from the `aqua_aws_onboarding` module, displaying the result of the onboarding process.

## Cleanup

To remove the resources created by this example, run `terraform destroy`.
